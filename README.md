# Intro-OpenRefine
An Introduction to OpenRefine (OR)

## What is OpenRefine?
OR is a generic data swiss-army knife. Using OR, one can quickly transform structure, filter out irrelevant data, or enrich existing data. The tool itself looks like a glorified spreadsheet editor, and hence the most basic "structure" that can be overlayed over existing data is to place everything into columns and rows.

The idea behind OR is to incorporate it into a larger workflow. Perhaps you are workig with one format, but need another. Perhaps you need a complex subset of a set of data, or maybe you need to merge two separate pieces of data. Along the way, by filtering and faceting, you constrain the data into subsets, run hypotheses about the total data-set, identify and fix irregularities, before spitting the data out again and moving on.

## A first look

OpenRefine is a service that runs on your computer, and is accessible through your web-browser at http://127.0.0.1:3333. If the programs appears to stall, then first try loading OR in a new tab or window in your browser, and second, try exiting/quiting the service/application.
